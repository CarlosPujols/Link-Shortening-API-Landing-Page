## Overview

This challenge requires the design of a landing page for a "Shortly" website, which basically generates short links out of a given URL. Theres desktop and mobile layouts. I generated different breakpoints with media queries trying to enhance experience for different display sizes. This features a responsive navbar with menu displaying/hidding on a hamburger menu button, usage of fetch API to retrieve links, sessionStorage to keep shortened links and copy-button functionality.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Fetch API
- SessionStorage


### What I learned

For this challenge i had to use sessionStorage to keep results on the page after refreshing the website.


### Continued development

This layout required detailed control of font-sizes and images in order to be responsive and still hold information correctly. Using clamp for CSS helped with this.

Will continue using this feature and planning it's execution ahead to save time.
